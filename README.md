Walkthrough
Best Practices for API Calls from Signup Page
Your current implementation follows many best practices, but there are some areas for improvement:
Strengths:
Client-side validation before API calls
Error handling with appropriate user feedback
Proper sequence - creating company first, then user
Clean separation of concerns in JavaScript functions
Recommendations for Improvement:
Security:
Implement CSRF protection for API requests
Consider using HTTPS for all API calls (appears to be in place)
Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
Performance:
Implement progressive loading indicators during API calls
Consider adding request timeouts and retry logic
User Experience:
Add more detailed error messages based on specific API failure responses
Implement form field persistence on page reload



Sign-in Page Features
User Interface:
Clean, consistent design that matches signup page
Form fields for email and password
"Remember me" checkbox
"Forgot password" link
Link to signup page for new users
JavaScript Functionality:
Client-side form validation
Loading indicator during API calls
Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
Token storage based on "remember me" preference
Email field auto-fill if previously used
Security Improvements:
Storing tokens in sessionStorage (or localStorage for remember me)
Password field clearing on failed login
Best Practices for API Calls (Answers to Question 1)
Your signup implementation follows most best practices, but here are recommendations for both signup and login pages:
Security:
Add CSRF protection for form submissions
Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
Use HTTPS for all API requests
Lock accounts after multiple failed attempts
Performance:
Added loading indicators during API calls
Implement request timeouts
Minimize payload size
User Experience:
More detailed error messages for specific failure cases
Remember fields (except passwords) between sessions
Added smooth validation with visual feedback
Implementation Improvements:
In the login page, I've added:
Loading spinner during API calls
Remembering user's email with localStorage
Proper token storage with session/localStorage
Detailed error handling
For the existing signup page, consider:
Adding loading indicators
Implementing similar error handling improvements
Adding basic form field persistence
Both pages now share a consistent user experience and implement modern web best practices for security and performance.
